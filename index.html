  <h4>my online class routine during covid-19</h4>
  as a quarantined college student, i wake up between 6 or 6.15 am in the morning before my 8am class, then i like to make my bed as one of the first things i do in a day. 
  I take a shower and get dressed. Sometimes i eat oatmeal for breakfast and drink a cup of milk almost every morning. Minutes before my first class, 
  i get on my phone and just go look for an updates on social media. After that, i open my laptop and wait the lecture to start the class. 
  Well, i kinda like this online learning because there is less noise when study at home compared to all of the roomates in dorm. I have so much time now to do things like sleep when i feel like it and
  basically have a lot of freedom. The important one is now i don't have to worry about rushing to the campus. 
  But as now after long time online study i started to feel bore because i can't spend time with my friends &#128532;
